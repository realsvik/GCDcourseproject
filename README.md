Data transformation is done by run_analysis.R help.
To work properly, script should be called from the folder, where the following files are present:

* x_test and x_train files with observation
* features.txt containes variable names
* y_train.txt, y_test.txt contain activity labels
* activities.txt contains activity names 
* subject_test.txt, subject_train.txt contain labels for subjects of the experiment

As output, script will create 2 files:
*result2.txt with intermediate dataset
*tidydataset.txt with final data set

Script should be sourced and called with mytransform() function.
